Pet Openstack
=============

Pet Openstack is a one node deployment of openstack designed for use under
Vagrant. It allows you to learn and modify your openstack without thinking
about how to recover your openstack if everything falls apart as a result of
your experiments.

This configuration is derived from course material of Openstack Training OS200
created by Polina Petriuk.

and your openstack node should be ready in about half of an hour.
